Hivetool.org is an open source project comprised of beekeepers who work in electronics
and information technology as programmers and database and system administrators. 
Our goal is to produce software tools to monitor, manage and research bees and honey production. 

The open source software is linux based (although it should run on Windows) that uses 
commercial, off the shelf, consumer grade (low cost) hardware. The software supports 
as many different brands of hardware as possible, to avoid being locked into one vendor, 
technology or computing platform as technology advances so rapidly. 

The plan is to populate a database with every variable we can measure, both in the hive 
(e.g. weight, temperature, humidity, bee counts, audio, video, VOCs), ambient conditions 
(solar radiation, barometric pressure, rain, wind, etc), - and hive parameters such as 
location, elevation, orientation, hive design, foundation material, etc. The data is both 
for our own research and management and for any other beekeeper, researcher or student for data mining. 

There are currently 4 hives on-line: GA003, GA004, GA005 and NC002. Several others should 
be on-line soon. GA006 is a Raspberry Pi board undergoing testing. Other facets of the 
project in the works are a smart phone app that will interface to the scale, temperature probes, 
etc for remote yards and a video camera bee counter using openCV libraries, 

All the data is available for download by anyone at anytime. We welcome engineers, programmers, 
scientists, researchers, bee keepers, and citizen scientists from anywhere around the world and 
invite you to join our effort.
